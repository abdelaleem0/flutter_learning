if yoc put BlocProvider in Main The BlocProvider not be create unless you use BlocProvider.of(Context),
untill this the blocProvider Not Created.


Using BlocProvider only where it is needed helps keep the code organized and
 reduces unnecessary coupling between components of your application.

When you add all BlocProvider instances in the main file,
it can make the codebase difficult to navigate,
especially as your application grows in size and complexity. This can make it harder to maintain and debug the code.

In contrast, if you only use BlocProvider where it is actually needed,
 it makes it easier to understand which BLoCs are used in each section of the app, and how they are used.
 This can make it easier to modify and maintain the codebase over time.

Additionally, if you add all BlocProvider instances in the main file,
 it may create unnecessary instances of BLoCs that are not needed in certain parts of the app.
  (^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^This can lead to unnecessary memory usage and slow down the performance of your app^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^).

Therefore, it is generally a good practice to use BlocProvider only where it is actually needed in order to keep the code organized and maintainable.
